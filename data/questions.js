    "q": "When addressing scope creep during installation, what formal document must be submitted to and approved by the client?",
    "options": [
      "Field Report",
      "Change Order",
      "Certificate of Substantial Completion",
      "Punch List"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Any addition or modification to agreed scope must be documented and priced via a Change Order before work proceeds."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Project Management",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What does the Certificate of Substantial Completion establish on an AV project?",
    "options": [
      "That every punch list item is closed and the contractor can leave the site",
      "That the system is usable for its intended purpose, starting the warranty clock",
      "That the client has accepted the system and released final payment and retainage",
      "That commissioning can begin now that all equipment is installed and powered"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Substantial completion means the owner can use the system for its intended purpose. Minor punch list items may remain open; warranty periods and final payment terms typically start here."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Project Management",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "In a project schedule, what does the critical path represent?",
    "options": [
      "The tasks carrying the highest budget, which need the closest cost control",
      "The longest sequence of dependent tasks, which sets the minimum project duration",

      "The shortest route through the task list, which sets the earliest finish date"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The critical path is the longest chain of dependent tasks. Any delay on it delays the whole project; tasks off it have float."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Sound & Physics",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "A speaker produces 80 dB SPL at 2 meters. What is the SPL at 4 meters in a free field?",

    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "Per the Potential Acoustic Gain concept, what is the most effective way to increase gain before feedback?",
    "options": [
      "Add amplifier headroom so the whole system can run louder before it starts to ring out",
      "Move the microphone closer to the talker and the loudspeaker farther from the mic",
      "Add more open microphones so each talker is picked up from farther away",
      "Boost the system EQ at the feedback frequency so the ring is masked by level"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "PAG/NAG is governed by distances. Shortening talker-to-mic distance and lengthening loudspeaker-to-mic distance both raise gain before feedback. Each doubling of open mics costs 3 dB."

      "18 A",
      "20 A"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Continuous loads are limited to 80% of the breaker rating. 20 × 0.8 = 16 A."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Electrical & Site Survey",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "A ground loop hum in an unbalanced audio run is best resolved by which approach?",
    "options": [
      "Lifting the safety ground pin on one piece of equipment's power cord",
      "Inserting an isolation transformer or converting the run to balanced",
      "Raising gain at the mixer input and lowering the amplifier to compensate",
      "Re-routing the cable along a longer path away from the power lines"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Never lift a safety ground — it is a life-safety hazard. Break the loop galvanically with an isolation transformer, or move to a balanced connection with differential rejection."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Video & Signal",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What is the approximate uncompressed bit rate of 1080p59.94 video at 4:2:2, 10-bit?",
    "options": [
      "1.5 Gbps",

      "12 Gbps"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "1080p at 59.94 fps needs roughly 3 Gbps, which is why it maps to 3G-SDI. 1080i59.94 fits in 1.5G-SDI."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Video & Signal",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "In HDCP, what is the practical consequence of a repeater exceeding its device or depth limit?",
    "options": [
      "Video falls back to standard definition so the content stays protected",
      "Authentication fails and downstream displays go blank or show an error",
      "Audio drops out while the video keeps playing at its full resolution",
      "The repeater re-encrypts with an older HDCP version and keeps passing video"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "HDCP repeaters have finite device counts and cascade depth. Exceeding either breaks authentication, and the sink shows black or an HDCP error rather than degrading gracefully."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Video & Signal",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What does EDID communicate in an HDMI link?",

      "SNTP / RFC 4330 (unicast)",
      "RTCP Sender Reports (RFC 3550)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "ST 2110-10 relies on Precision Time Protocol v2 under the SMPTE ST 2059-2 profile for frame-accurate sync over IP."
  },

    "options": [
      "It replaces uncompressed SDI with a compressed IP payload to reduce overall network bandwidth",
      "It carries video, audio, and ancillary data as separate essence streams rather than one encapsulated SDI signal",
      "It replaces the PTP precision clocking of ST 2022-6 with standard NTP time synchronization",
      "It requires single-mode fiber for every network link, because copper cabling cannot carry separate essence streams"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "ST 2022-6 wraps a whole SDI signal in IP. ST 2110 splits essences into independent streams that can be routed, shuffled, and processed separately."
  },
  {
    "domain": "Advanced: ST 2110 Suite",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What does ST 2110-21 define?",

    "q": "How does a receiver handle duplicate streams under SMPTE ST 2022-7?",
    "options": [
      "It averages the two streams sample by sample to cancel out network jitter",
      "It performs packet-by-packet hitless merge using RTP sequence numbers",
      "It ignores the secondary stream until the primary link reports a failure",
      "It converts both streams to SDI and switches between them on loss of signal"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "ST 2022-7 reconstructs an uninterrupted stream from identical RTP sequence numbers arriving on two independent network fabrics, so a fabric failure causes no visible glitch."
  },

    "domain": "Advanced: ST 2110 Suite",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "In a PTP domain, what is the role of the Boundary Clock in a leaf-spine media network?",
    "options": [
      "It generates the master time reference from a GPS receiver and distributes it as the domain grandmaster",
      "It syncs to the grandmaster on one port and re-serves timing downstream, offloading the grandmaster",
      "It converts incoming PTP timing to NTP so that legacy devices can synchronize to the media network",
      "It measures multicast bandwidth on the leaf-spine fabric to detect oversubscription of media flows"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A Boundary Clock syncs to the upstream grandmaster and acts as master to devices below it, which scales PTP distribution and limits accumulated jitter."
  },

  {
    "domain": "Advanced: Dante & AES67",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What is the relationship between Dante and AES67?",
    "options": [
      "They are the same protocol: AES67 is simply the standards body's name for Dante",
      "Dante can switch on an AES67 mode to interoperate, though its native discovery differs",
      "AES67 is a licensed subset of Dante, so every AES67 device can join a Dante network natively",
      "They cannot interoperate, because Dante's proprietary clocking is incompatible"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Dante is a proprietary ecosystem with its own discovery and clocking. Enabling AES67 mode exposes standards-based multicast streams that other AES67 devices can subscribe to, with constraints on sample rate and packet time."
  },

      "The routing table that decides which devices subscribe",
      "The PTP reference all devices sync their sample clocks to",
      "Network-wide gain staging so every channel arrives at level",
      "The naming service that resolves device and channel labels"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Dante elects a Leader clock by PTP. All devices word-clock to it, which is what allows sample-accurate playout across the network."

      "The ratio of the projector's lumens to the screen area",
      "The ratio of the lens-to-screen distance to the image height"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Throw Ratio = Distance / Width. A 1.5:1 throw means the projector must be 1.5 times the image width away from the screen."
  },

      "A screen surface with too much gain for the viewing angle"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Keystoning occurs when the projector is not perpendicular to the screen, causing the image to appear as a trapezoid."

    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What is the primary purpose of a 'Bass Trap' in a room's acoustic treatment?",
    "options": [
      "To reinforce low frequencies so the room sounds fuller in corners",
      "To absorb low-frequency standing waves typically found in corners",
      "To diffuse high frequencies so reflections spread evenly in the room",
      "To block low-frequency sound from leaking into the adjacent rooms"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Low frequencies have long wavelengths and accumulate in corners. Bass traps are designed to absorb these specific frequencies to reduce 'boominess'."

      "To document the as-built drawings so the client can sign the invoice"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Commissioning is the formal process of testing and documenting that every system function works as specified in the original design."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Electrical & Site Survey",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "When performing a site survey, why is it critical to identify the 'HVAC noise floor'?",
    "options": [
      "To determine whether the HVAC can handle the equipment rack heat load",
      "To ensure the audio system can beat the background noise for intelligible speech",
      "To calculate how much electrical load the HVAC places on the room circuits",
      "To locate the condensate lines and ducts that could leak onto ceiling-mounted equipment"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "If the background noise (HVAC) is too high, the audio system must be louder to be heard, which can increase the risk of feedback and reduce clarity."
  },
  {
    "domain": "CTS: Sound & Physics",
    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What is the standard impedance of professional audio equipment?",
    "options": [
      "75 ohms",
      "50 ohms",
      "600 ohms",
      "300 ohms"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Legacy professional audio gear was designed around 600-ohm circuits, a standard inherited from telephone networks. Matching impedances was once critical for maximum power transfer; modern bridging inputs just need to be at least 10x the source impedance. On the exam, 600 ohms is the answer they expect for professional audio impedance."

    "options": [
      "Sound Power Level",
      "Sound Pressure Level",
      "Signal Processing Level",
      "Speaker Performance Level"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "SPL stands for Sound Pressure Level, measured in decibels relative to the threshold of human hearing (20 micropascals, defined as 0 dB SPL). It describes acoustic pressure in air, unlike dBu or dBV which describe electrical signal levels. Almost every audio measurement question on the exam ties back to SPL."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Standard copper HDMI cables are built from multiple shielded twisted pairs that carry the high-speed TMDS data, plus separate conductors for control and power. The twisted-pair construction rejects electromagnetic interference, which is essential at HDMI data rates. Fiber-optic HDMI exists too, but it converts the signal to light for long runs rather than being the standard copper construction."

    "explanation": "NTSC analog video refreshes at 59.94 Hz (often rounded to 60 Hz) — the odd fraction comes from a 1953 tweak that prevented the color subcarrier from interfering with the audio carrier. PAL/SECAM regions standardized on 50 Hz tied to their mains frequency. For digital formats this lives on as 59.94 fps and 29.97 fps frame rates."

    "explanation": "Professional console mic preamps present about 2k ohms (2,000 ohms) of input impedance — roughly ten times the ~150-200 ohm source impedance of a typical dynamic mic. This 'bridging' ratio transfers voltage efficiently without loading the microphone. Lower impedance would load the mic and dull the sound; the 10:1 rule is the design principle behind it."

    "explanation": "4:4:4 chroma subsampling keeps full color resolution for every pixel — no chroma is discarded, unlike 4:2:2 (half horizontal color resolution) or 4:2:0 (quarter). That makes 4:4:4 the best choice for text, graphics, and color-critical content where subsampled color would blur edges. It costs more bandwidth, which is why video distribution often uses 4:2:0 instead."

    "explanation": "T568A and T568B are the two standard twisted-pair termination schemes, and the 'T' stands for Telecommunications (from the TIA — Telecommunications Industry Association — standards). The only difference between them is which color pairs land on pins 1-2 versus 3-6. What matters on the job is using the same scheme at both ends, or a proper crossover when needed."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "XLR connectors carry phantom power: 48V DC applied equally to pins 2 and 3 relative to pin 1 (ground), so condenser microphone capsules get power without disturbing the balanced audio signal. Dynamic mics simply ignore it. This is why phantom power only appears on mic inputs with XLRs — RCA, TS, and 3.5mm connectors don't support it."

    "explanation": "The CD Red Book standard specifies 16-bit audio at a 44.1 kHz sample rate — 16 bits gives ~96 dB of theoretical dynamic range. Professional production moved to 24-bit (144 dB theoretical) for more headroom during mixing, though delivery is still often 16-bit.

    "explanation": "Absorptive treatments like acoustic foam convert sound energy into heat through friction in the porous material, reducing reflections and reverberation.

    "explanation": "For detailed 4K UHD content, design guidance puts the optimal viewing distance around 1.5 times the image height — close enough that the eye can actually resolve the extra pixels, per AVIXA DISCAS viewing-distance principles. Sit much farther and the eye can't distinguish 4K from 1080p, wasting the resolution. Farther viewing (3x height or more) is for passive viewing where detail doesn't matter."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Ribbon microphones are the most wind- and blast-sensitive: their ultra-thin corrugated ribbon element can be stretched or torn by strong air movement, which is why they're always used with pop filters and kept away from wind. Condenser and shotgun mics are also wind-sensitive, but a ribbon can be physically damaged. Dynamic mics are the most rugged choice outdoors."

    "explanation": "Commercial AV control systems speak multiple protocols because different devices need different ones: RS-232 for simple point-to-point serial control, RS-485 for longer multi-drop runs, and TCP/IP for networked devices. A single control processor typically has ports for all three. The exam wants you to know that control is multi-protocol by nature — no single standard covers everything."

    "explanation": "Wireless microphone range depends on every link in the chain: transmitter RF power and battery condition, antenna type/placement (diversity reception), and the RF environment (interference, obstacles, competing systems). Weakening any one of them shortens usable range. That's why the exam answer is 'all of the above' — range is a system property, not one spec."

    "explanation": "OLED produces the deepest blacks because each pixel generates its own light and can switch completely off — true zero light output, giving effectively infinite contrast. LCD/LED-LCD always has a backlight, so blacks are really dark gray from light leakage. Plasma had excellent blacks too but is discontinued; OLED is the current reference."

    "explanation": "DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS servers to devices when they join a network — no manual addressing needed.

    "explanation": "XLR is the balanced audio connector: its three pins carry ground plus a differential signal pair that cancels induced hum and noise, allowing microphone cable runs of hundreds of feet. RCA and 1/4-inch TS are unbalanced; 3.5mm TRS is typically unbalanced stereo in consumer gear. On a pro job, balanced XLR is the default for mic-level runs."

    "explanation": "A scaler converts video from one resolution to another — e.g., scaling a 1080p laptop output up to fill a 4K display, or down to match a projector's native resolution. Good scaling preserves image quality; cheap scaling softens detail or adds latency. Switchers route sources, recorders capture them, distributors split them — scalers change their resolution."

    "explanation": "H.264 (AVC) remains the best-supported codec for live streaming because every device, browser, and platform decodes it in hardware with low latency — universal compatibility beats raw efficiency for live delivery. H.265 compresses better but needs more processing and has licensing friction. ProRes and MJPEG are production/editing codecs, far too heavy for streaming."

Beyond that, signal attenuation causes dropouts, sparkles, or complete loss.

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Reverberation time depends on everything that shapes how sound decays in a room: its volume (size), its geometry (shape — parallel walls cause flutter echo), and its surface materials (absorption coefficients). Change any one and RT60 changes. That's why acoustic treatment starts with measuring the room, not just adding panels."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The classic stereo listening setup places the two speakers and the listener at the corners of an equilateral triangle, so each speaker is the same distance from the listener and from each other. This gives a centered, stable stereo image with correct phantom-center placement. Angling the speakers inward (toe-in) toward the listener completes the setup."

    "explanation": "A compressor reduces a signal's dynamic range by automatically turning down the loudest parts once they cross a threshold — making quiet passages more audible and loud peaks more controlled. Ratio, attack, and release shape how aggressively it works. It doesn't just 'increase volume'; makeup gain afterward restores overall level with the peaks tamed."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Balanced lines (XLR/TRS) reject induced noise through common-mode rejection — interference picked up equally on both conductors cancels at the differential receiver.

    "explanation": "A limiter is a compressor with a very high ratio (often ∞:1) that acts as a ceiling: nothing passes above the threshold, preventing clipping and protecting speakers and ears. It's the last stage of protection in a signal chain. Unlike a compressor's gentle shaping, a limiter's job is purely protective — brick-wall level control."

    "explanation": "Latency is the time delay between a signal entering a system and emerging — caused by analog-to-digital conversion, DSP processing, network buffering, and codec encode/decode. In AV it shows up as lip-sync error, delayed foldback for performers, and sluggish video-conference interaction. Every digital stage adds latency, so system design is about budgeting it end to end."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "LED-backlit LCD wins in bright environments because it can push very high brightness (1,000+ nits) to overcome ambient light, and it suffers no burn-in from static content the way OLED and plasma can. OLED has better blacks and contrast in controlled light, but washes out under bright ambient. For lobbies, retail, and outdoor-adjacent installs, high-brightness LED LCD is the safe specification."

    "explanation": "Uncompressed audio needs the most bandwidth because every sample is stored or transmitted in full — e.g., stereo 48 kHz/24-bit is about 2.3 Mbps before any overhead. Compressed formats (MP3, AAC) discard psychoacoustically masked data to shrink that dramatically. Analog isn't measured in digital bandwidth, and wireless is a transport, not a format — uncompressed digital is the bandwidth hog."

      "To test the installed system against the original design specifications"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A needs analysis defines the client's goals, tasks, and problems first — the 'why' behind the project. Equipment selection, scheduling, and testing all come later and depend on it. Designing without a needs analysis risks building an impressive system that solves the wrong problem."

      "Needs are required for the system to do its job; wants are desirable but optional",
      "Wants cost more than needs, so they are always cut first from the budget",
      "Needs come from the end users, while the wants come from the executive sponsors"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Separating must-haves from nice-to-haves lets you protect the core functionality when budget or schedule gets tight. Document both, but design the system around the needs first. This prioritization is what keeps scope creep from derailing the project."

      "A signed service and maintenance contract covering post-warranty support and response times"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The needs assessment (program report) captures what was discovered: business goals, user workflows, technical requirements, constraints, budget range, and how success will be measured.

    ],
    "correct": 1,

      "A needs analysis covers the audio requirements; a site survey covers the video"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The needs analysis answers 'what must the system do?' while the site survey answers 'what are we working with physically?' — room dimensions, structure, power, HVAC noise, lighting, network drops, and pathways.

      "Accessibility is handled by the architect, so AV design can leave it out"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Public assembly spaces carry legal accessibility obligations — assistive listening systems, clear sight lines to captioning/displays, and controls usable by people with disabilities. Capturing these in needs analysis means they're designed in from the start, not retrofitted at penalty cost after inspection."

      "The closest viewer's distance and the display's native resolution"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "DISCAS sizes the image from the back of the room forward: the farthest viewer must be able to resolve the smallest critical detail (the 'content element'). Lumen output affects visibility in ambient light, not legibility of detail. This is why the same room needs a bigger image for spreadsheet review than for passive video watching."

      "Approximately 5 times the image height",
      "There is no minimum; closer is always better"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Viewers closer than about 2x image height on a 1080p display start resolving the pixel structure, which degrades the image and causes eye fatigue. This sets the front-row limit in design. Higher resolutions (4K) allow closer seating — roughly 1.5x height — because the pixels are smaller."

      "Adjacent speakers are spaced so their levels differ by 3 dB at the boundary"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Uniform coverage means every seat hears essentially the same level — AVIXA A102.01 sets the tolerance framework. A ±3 dB window is a common design target because variations smaller than that are barely noticeable to listeners. Achieving it drives speaker quantity, placement, and tap settings in a distributed design."

    "q": "Why must ambient light levels be measured during the design phase for a projection system?",
    "options": [
      "Ambient light has no measurable effect on projected images, so measuring it during design adds nothing of value",
      "Projected contrast washes out as ambient light rises, so brightness, screen choice, or light control must compensate",
      "Ambient light measurement determines the projector’s throw ratio, which then drives the lens selection for the room",
      "Ambient light readings are only required to satisfy the electrical permit and have no bearing on the projection design"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A projector can't project black — dark areas of the image are just the screen showing ambient light. As ambient light rises, contrast ratio collapses regardless of lumen output. Measuring it tells you whether you need a brighter projector, an ambient-light-rejecting screen, or lighting control — decisions that must happen in design, not after installation."

    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "What is the recommended maximum conduit fill for AV cabling pathways?",
    "options": [
      "100%, since low-voltage cable produces no heat and conduit is costly",
      "Approximately 40%, leaving room for future expansion and heat dissipation",
      "80%, which is the same figure as the continuous-load derating rule for breakers",
      "About 60%, leaving just enough room to pull one more cable later on"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The 40% fill guideline leaves space to pull additional cable later without damaging existing runs, and reduces heat buildup. A conduit packed to 100% is effectively a dead end — the first future upgrade becomes a demolition project. Designing pathways for growth is a hallmark of professional AV design."

    "options": [
      "It is only required for outdoor racks that sit in direct sun through the summer",
      "Excess heat shortens equipment life and causes failures, so cooling is designed in",
      "It sets the rack's weight rating, since steel loses strength as it gets hotter",
      "Only the amplifiers make meaningful heat, so the calculation only covers those"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Every watt a rack's equipment consumes becomes heat. Without planned ventilation or active cooling, rack temperatures climb, components drift out of spec, and failures follow — usually after the warranty conversation gets awkward. Good design totals the thermal load and provides a cooling path before equipment is ordered."

      "It is mainly a sales document that shows the client the overall scope of the whole project"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The signal flow diagram is the design's single source of truth: installers build from it, and technicians troubleshoot from it for the life of the system. When something fails at 8am before a board meeting, the tech traces the path on this drawing. Incomplete signal documentation is a design defect."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "If the bottom of the image sits below the sight lines of the back rows, those viewers see the backs of heads instead of content. The 42-48 inch guideline keeps the image above a seated audience's heads. Screen height, ceiling height, and projector placement all interact here — it's a three-way design compromise."

    "cert": "CTS",
    "q": "Why should AV traffic be placed on a separate VLAN or physical network from general corporate data?",
    "options": [
      "Because AV devices can't use the standard TCP/IP stack found on office networks",
      "To guarantee bandwidth, prioritize latency-sensitive media, and meet IT security policy",
      "Because a VLAN raises the total speed available on all the switch ports that AV devices use",
      "It is rarely needed, because a shared flat network always handles AV traffic fine"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Media traffic (Dante, NDI, control) is sensitive to latency and packet loss that bursty office data causes, and IT departments rightly resist unknown devices on the corporate LAN. A dedicated AV VLAN with QoS gives the media traffic priority and gives IT the security boundary they require. This conversation happens in design, with IT at the table."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A Gantt chart turns a task list into a schedule you can actually manage: you see what happens in what order, which tasks depend on others, and where the milestones fall.

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Mains-frequency hum (60 Hz in North America, 50 Hz elsewhere) is the signature of a ground loop — current flowing between chassis grounds at different potentials, often via cable shields.

    "explanation": "Feedback is a gain-before-feedback problem solved in order of effectiveness: less gain needed (move mic closer to talker), more distance between mics and speakers, then surgical EQ notches at the ringing frequencies.

    "explanation": "A laptop is an unknown variable — wrong resolution, HDCP issues, sleep mode. A test pattern generator outputs a precise, known signal, so any fault you see is definitively in the distribution path, not the source.

    "explanation": "Network troubleshooting follows the OSI model from the bottom up: no link light means a physical problem (cable, port, PoE), and link-with-no-communication means an addressing problem (wrong subnet, VLAN, or DHCP failure).

    "options": [
      "Gain staging is not important — modern DSPs auto-correct any level mismatch, so audio troubleshooting can begin anywhere in the chain",
      "Proper gain staging keeps each device in its optimal range; bad staging causes noise or distortion that mimics other faults",
      "It only affects the subwoofers — full-range speakers and microphones operate independently of the system's overall gain structure",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "If the first device in the chain is clipping or starved, every downstream symptom — distortion, hiss, weak output — is a lie told by bad gain structure.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Dante is real-time audio over IP: it needs QoS prioritizing PTP clocking, IGMP snooping so multicast doesn't flood every port, and gigabit (or better) backbones. The AV designer specifies these switch requirements for IT — 'the network just works' is not a design."

      "One mix fits all purposes — the in-room reinforcement feed is ideal for the stream, since remote viewers want to hear exactly what the room hears",
      "Separate mix buses: a reinforcement mix tuned for the room and a discrete stream/record mix with its own EQ, levels and audience-mic balance",
      "Just turn up the room mics for the stream — pushing the audience mics hotter in the reinforcement mix produces a complete broadcast-ready stream",

      "Reaching ~10–15 dB signal-to-noise takes directional speakers, zoned levels, maybe exhibit noise control; if physics won't allow it, reset expectations",
      "Just add more speakers — doubling the speaker count doubles intelligibility, so a dense enough ceiling speaker grid overcomes any ambient noise level",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Intelligibility needs signal comfortably above noise. At 85 dBA ambient, narration needs ~95–100 dBA at the listener — potentially unsafe and impractical. The designer must confront this with directional audio, zoning, or honest expectation-setting, not wishful speaker counts."

      "Staging signal levels through each device (mic → preamp → DSP → amp) for maximum signal-to-noise without clipping; the designer sets nominal levels and headroom",
      "It means turning everything up — proper gain structure means maximizing every gain stage in the chain, since hotter signals always produce better sound",

      "Pixel pitch vs. viewing distance: at 10 ft, ~1.2mm is near retina resolution, so finer pitch wastes budget and coarser pitch shows pixels",
      "Brighter is always better — specify the highest-nit panels available; brightness is the only specification that affects what the viewer perceives at 10 feet",

    "correct": 1,

    "options": [
      "No difference — RS-232 and IR carry identical control commands with the same reliability, and both interfaces provide two-way status feedback from the display",
      "RS-232 is two-way (the system can query power/input status) and reliable over distance; IR is one-way, line-of-sight, and can be blocked or interfered with",
      "IR is always better — IR provides two-way status feedback and works through walls and around corners, making it more reliable than RS-232 over long distances",
